            <h2>Duque, Galvez should take first dose of ‘safe’ COVID-19 vaccine, says Go</h2>
            <p class="author">Katrina Hallare</p>

            <p>MANILA, Philippines — Senator Christopher “Bong” Go thinks that Health Secretary Francisco Duque III and vaccine czar and National Task Force (NTF) Against COVID-19 chief Carlito Galvez Jr. should take the first dose of the “safe” COVID-19 vaccine once it becomes available in the country.
                </p>
            <p>“I’m challenging Secretary Galvez, once available na po ‘yung safe na vaccine, ipapakita niya, along with Secretary Duque, sila po ang unang magpapaturok ng vaccine to encourage naman po [mga tao],” Go said during the Laging Handa online press briefing.
                </p>
            
            <p>(I’m challenging Secretary Galvez, once a safe vaccine is available, he along with Secretary Duque should show that they will get the first dose of the vaccine to encourage people.)
            </p>
            <p>
                Go said that the safety of the vaccine must be ensured since, he said, people still have doubts about taking it.

                “May mga naga-alinlangan pa, kaya dapat unahin natin itong safety ng vaccine na ito,” he said.
                
            </p>
            <p>
                (There are still some who doubt it, that is why we should prioritize its safety first.)

                The government is targeting to inoculate 50 to 60 percent of the country’s population to achieve herd immunity concept in vaccination wherein enough people in a specific area are protected against infectious disease.
 
            </p>
            <p>
                Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III said that the government was eyeing to use P73 billion worth of loans to buy the COVID-19 vaccines for 60 million people.
